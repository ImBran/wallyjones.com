                <h1>Hello,<br/>I'm Wally Jones.</h1>
            </div>
            <p>I like to learn, I like to eat vegetables, and I like to drink coffee but not necessarily all at the same time. Coffee with vegetables would be disgusting. Let's say the coffee and vegetables are mutually exclusive.</p> 
            <p>I also enjoy programming and exploring computer systems where a majority of the time I find myself venturing lower and lower into the abstractions that comprise these interesting machines. It seems the more you uncover the more you realise how little you know.</p> 
            <p>My career so far has been spent as a Web Programmer but lately the areas of Systems Programming, UNIX, PLT, and Cryptography interest me the most.</p>
            <p> For the times I'm not around a computer I'm probably out exploring the world and getting lost in the woods.</p>
            <p>Currently I work just outside of the Philadelphia area as a full-stack engineer at <a href="https://dccc.edu">DCCC</a> where I have designed, coded, hacked on, and deployed many of the public facing and internal systems.</p>
            <p>You can find me around the net on various services by following the links below.</p>
